# UI Challenge

## Overview

This project is a submission for the Flutter Developer position. The task was to develop the UI for two design mockups using Flutter, ensuring responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The project also includes a dark mode toggle, basic UI animations, and unit tests for model classes and key functionalities.

## Features

- Responsive UI: The application is designed to be responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Dark Mode: A button to toggle between light and dark modes.
- Animations: Basic UI animations to enhance user experience.
- State Management: Utilized GetX for state management and dependency injection.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OmarAmeer96/ui_challenge.git
cd ui_challenge
```

2. Install dependencies:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the application:

```sh
flutter run
```


## Approach

UI Design

- Responsiveness: Used LayoutBuilder, MediaQuery, and ScreenUtil to ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes.
- Dark Mode: Implemented a toggle button using GetX to switch between light and dark themes.
- Animations: Added basic animations using Flutter's built-in animation widgets.

State Management
- Utilized GetX for state management, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

Assumptions

- The design mockups provided were followed closely, with some creative liberties taken for animations and minor UI enhancements.
- The project was developed using the latest available Flutter SDK version at the time of development.

Time Spent

- Approximately 15 hours were spent on this task, including planning, development, and documentation.


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to develop responsive and maintainable Flutter applications, effectively use GetX for state management, and write comprehensive unit tests. I look forward to discussing my approach and experience in more detail during the final interview.
