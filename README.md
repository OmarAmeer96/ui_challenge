## Approach

UI Design

- Responsiveness: Used LayoutBuilder, MediaQuery, and ScreenUtil to ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes.
- Dark Mode: Implemented a toggle button using GetX to switch between light and dark themes.
- Animations: Added basic animations using Flutter's built-in animation widgets.

State Management
- Utilized GetX for state management, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

Assumptions

- The design mockups provided were followed closely, with some creative liberties taken for animations and minor UI enhancements.
- The project was developed using the latest available Flutter SDK version at the time of development.

Time Spent

- Approximately 15 hours were spent on this task, including planning, development, and documentation.


## Conclusion
This project is a testament to my ability to:

- Translate static designs into dynamic, user-friendly applications.
- Write clean, maintainable code while adhering to industry best practices.
- Deliver responsive and visually engaging interfaces using Flutter.

I am excited to bring these skills to your team and contribute to building innovative solutions that users love! I look forward to discussing the project in greater detail during our next interaction.
